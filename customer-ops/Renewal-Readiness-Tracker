# Renewal Readiness Tracker (T-90 to Renewal)
A structured tracker to run renewals as a discipline: **readiness signals, risk controls, save motions, and forecast hygiene**.

---

## 1) Outcome
Reduce renewal surprises by making readiness measurable and owned.

**Definition of done (weekly):**
- Renewal timeline is updated for every in-scope account
- Risks have owners, due dates, and next actions
- Forecast reflects reality (with evidence)
- Escalations happen early, not late

---

## 2) Scope
**Applies to:** all accounts inside the renewal window  
Recommended windows:
- Enterprise: **T-120** to renewal
- Mid-market: **T-90** to renewal
- SMB: **T-60** to renewal

**Owner:** CSM (Responsible), CS Ops (Accountable for process hygiene)

---

## 3) Ownership (RACI)
| Area | Responsible | Accountable | Consulted | Informed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tracker updates | CSM | CS Ops / Head CS | Support Lead | Sales |
| Commercials and pricing | CSM + Sales | Sales Lead | Finance | Head CS |
| Product dependencies | CSM | Head CS | Product/Eng | Sales |
| Exec escalations | CSM | Head CS | Founder/Leadership | Sales/Finance |

---

## 4) Renewal timeline (stage gates)
Use these gates. If a gate is missed, the account is automatically “At Risk”.

### Gate definitions
- **T-90:** Renewal plan locked + stakeholder map validated
- **T-60:** Value proof captured + risk register updated
- **T-45:** Commercial path aligned (pricing, terms, procurement route)
- **T-30:** Renewal decision path confirmed (who signs, by when)
- **T-14:** Final paperwork in motion, zero unknowns
- **T-0:** Renewal closed (or churn prevented with closure notes)

## 5) Readiness signals (simple and measurable)

| Signal | Green | Amber | Red |
|---|---|---|---|
| Stakeholder access | sponsor engaged in last 30 days | champion only | no sponsor access |
| Outcome progress | on-track vs success criteria | slipping | blocked / unclear |
| Adoption health | Green band | Amber band | Red band |
| Value proof | ≥ 1 measurable win captured | qualitative only | none |
| Commercial clarity | pricing + terms path known | partial | unknown |
| Procurement timeline | confirmed | assumed | unknown |
| Product blockers | none | manageable | critical unresolved |

---

## 6) Renewal risk register (embedded)
Maintain a risk register for each account inside this tracker.

| Account | Renewal date | Forecast (Commit/Best/At Risk) | Top risk | Risk owner | Mitigation action | Due date | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| {{ACCOUNT}} | {{DATE}} | {{Commit/Best/At Risk}} | {{Risk}} | {{Owner}} | {{Action}} | {{DATE}} | {{Open/Closed}} |

---

## 7) Save motion (when an account is At Risk)
Use this section only when risk is Amber/Red.

### Save motion checklist
- Confirm churn reason category: {{Product / Value / Stakeholder / Commercial / Support / Competition}}
- Define “save outcome” for next 14 days: {{Outcome}}
- Identify minimum viable fix: {{Fix}}
- Exec sponsor touchpoint scheduled: {{Yes/No, Date}}
- Commercial path decided: {{discount / terms / phased rollout / escalation}}

### Save motion actions table
| Action | Owner | Due date | Evidence required | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| {{Action}} | {{Name}} | {{Date}} | {{Link/Metric}} | {{Open/Done}} |

---

## 8) Forecast hygiene rules (non-negotiable)
A forecast label must have evidence:

- **Commit** means: decision path confirmed + commercial route known + no critical blockers
- **Best case** means: risks exist but mitigations are in motion with dates
- **At risk** means: stakeholder access unclear OR value proof missing OR procurement path unknown OR adoption Red

Never keep an account in “Commit” if any Red signal exists.

---

## 9) Weekly renewal review (agenda)
Run a 30–45 minute review weekly for renewal cohort.

Inputs:
- Health Signals Template
- Renewal tracker
- Support and product blockers

Outputs:
- Forecast updates
- Save motion launches
- Escalations with owners and deadlines

---

## 10) Sanitization rules (public repo)
Replace all identifiers with placeholders:
`{{CUSTOMER_NAME}}`, `{{ACCOUNT_ID}}`, `{{CSM_NAME}}`
No PII, no private URLs, no internal IDs, no confidential pricing.
