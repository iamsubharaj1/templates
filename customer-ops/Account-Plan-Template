# Account Plan Template
A plug-and-play, fillable account operating document to manage one customer across outcomes, adoption, renewal readiness, and expansion.

## What this folder contains
This folder is the **canonical source** for the account plan template and its operating standards.

**Required**
- `README.md` (this file)

**Expected (create if missing)**
- `Account-Plan-Template.md` (the fillable template you copy per account)

**Optional (recommended for scale)**
- `examples/` (sanitized examples using placeholders only)
- `snippets/` (reusable blocks: risk register, stakeholder map, exec summary)

## TL;DR
- Copy the template into `accounts/{{ACCOUNT_KEY}}/Account-Plan.md`
- Fill the Day 1 baseline (Outcomes, Stakeholders, Adoption baseline, Risks, 30-day plan, Renewal date path)
- Update weekly, rebaseline at 90/60/30 days pre-renewal
- Use the Exec Summary for leadership and escalation readiness

## How to use
### 1) Create an account instance (recommended)
Create a per-account plan file and paste the template contents into it:

- Path: `accounts/{{ACCOUNT_KEY}}/Account-Plan.md`
- Source: `Account-Plan-Template.md` (copy-paste)

### 2) Day 1 baseline (minimum viable plan)
Your plan is not usable unless these are complete:
- Success outcomes (2 to 5) with metric, baseline, target, target date
- Renewal date and renewal path steps (placeholders only in a public repo)
- Stakeholder map (champion, decision maker, procurement, exec sponsor)
- Adoption baseline and top gaps
- Top 3 risks with triggers, mitigations, owner, review date
- Next 30-day action plan with owners and due dates
- Exec Summary that matches the above

### 3) Operating cadence
- Weekly: update actions, risks, stakeholder sentiment, adoption signals
- Monthly: refresh value proof and milestones
- Pre-renewal: run a 90/60/30 rebaseline (renewal gaps, stakeholder alignment, proof readiness)

## Quality bar and standards
A “gold standard” account plan is:

- **Outcome-first:** every action ties to a measurable customer outcome or commercial objective
- **Evidence-based:** adoption, value, and risk are supported by dated signals, not opinions
- **Accountable:** one owner per action, explicit due dates, and a success check
- **Renewal-aware:** renewal confidence is explained (why yes, why not, what changes it)
- **Decision-ready:** leadership can scan the Exec Summary and decide next steps quickly
- **Handover-proof:** a new owner can run the next 30 days without a separate handover call

### Definition of Done checklist
Use this to validate a filled account plan:
- [ ] 2 to 5 outcomes exist, each with metric, baseline, target, target date
- [ ] Renewal date and renewal path steps captured (placeholders if public)
- [ ] Stakeholders include influence, sentiment, and “next move”
- [ ] Adoption baseline is stated and gaps are explicit
- [ ] Top 3 risks have triggers, mitigations, owners, review dates
- [ ] Next 30 days has prioritized actions with owners, due dates, success checks
- [ ] Exec Summary is current and consistent with the plan

## File map
Recommended folder usage pattern:

- `templates/customer-ops/Account-Plan-Template/`
  - `README.md`
  - `Account-Plan-Template.md`
  - `examples/` (optional)
  - `snippets/` (optional)

Recommended per-account instantiation (elsewhere):
- `accounts/{{ACCOUNT_KEY}}/Account-Plan.md`

## Naming convention
- `{{ACCOUNT_KEY}}`: lowercase, hyphenated, no spaces  
  Example: `acme-co`, `northwind-enterprises`

- Dates: `YYYY-MM-DD`

## Sanitization and privacy rules (public repo-safe)
This repo is public. Do not include real customer data.

Never include:
- Customer names, domains, emails, phone numbers, addresses
- Pricing, discounts, contract value, invoices, payment terms
- Internal tool links (CRM, ticketing, BI), screenshots, exports, recordings
- Security details, architecture diagrams, incident specifics tied to a real customer

Use placeholders consistently:
- `{{ACCOUNT_NAME}}`, `{{ACCOUNT_KEY}}`, `{{RENEWAL_DATE}}`, `{{PRODUCTS_IN_SCOPE}}`
- `{{STAKEHOLDER_1}}`, `{{OUTCOME_1}}`, `{{METRIC_1}}`, `{{BASELINE_1}}`, `{{TARGET_1}}`
