# Health Signals Template (Customer Ops)
A structured template to detect risk early using **leading indicators**, trigger **standard interventions**, and run a predictable weekly review.

---

## 1) Outcome
Detect adoption and renewal risk early, trigger interventions on time, and maintain a single view of account health that is **owned**, **measurable**, and **actionable**.

**Definition of done (weekly):**
- Signals updated for target accounts
- Risks tagged with owners and due dates
- Interventions launched for any breached thresholds
- Next review date locked

---

## 2) Scope
**Applies to:** accounts in onboarding, adoption, or renewal window  
**Frequency:** weekly (or twice weekly for high-risk cohorts)  
**Owner:** CSM / Customer Ops owner (primary), with support from Product/Support as needed

---

## 3) Ownership (RACI)
| Area | Responsible | Accountable | Consulted | Informed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Signal updates | CSM | Head CS / CS Ops | Support Lead | Sales |
| Risk tagging + plan | CSM | Head CS / CS Ops | Product/Eng | Leadership |
| Intervention execution | CSM + Support | Head CS | Product/Eng | Sales |
| Renewal escalation | CSM | Head CS | Finance | Founder/Leadership (if needed) |

---

## 4) Signal set (use the ones relevant to your business)
Use 8 to 12 signals. Too many signals kills adoption.

### A) Product and usage signals (leading)
| Signal | Definition | Threshold (Green) | Threshold (Amber) | Threshold (Red) | Data source |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Active users | Unique active users in last 7 days | ≥ {{G_ACTIVE_USERS}} | {{A_ACTIVE_USERS}}–{{G_ACTIVE_USERS-1}} | < {{A_ACTIVE_USERS}} | {{SOURCE}} |
| Usage frequency | Active days per week | ≥ {{G_ACTIVE_DAYS}} | {{A_ACTIVE_DAYS}}–{{G_ACTIVE_DAYS-1}} | < {{A_ACTIVE_DAYS}} | {{SOURCE}} |
| Key feature adoption | % accounts using key feature | ≥ {{G_FEATURE}}% | {{A_FEATURE}}–{{G_FEATURE-1}}% | < {{A_FEATURE}}% | {{SOURCE}} |
| Time-to-value milestone | milestone achieved by date | On track | At risk | Missed | {{SOURCE}} |

### B) Engagement signals (leading)
| Signal | Definition | Green | Amber | Red | Data source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Stakeholder engagement | touchpoints in last 14 days | ≥ {{G_TOUCH}} | {{A_TOUCH}}–{{G_TOUCH-1}} | 0 or 1 | {{SOURCE}} |
| Exec sponsor presence | sponsor attended in last 30 days | Yes | Unclear | No | {{SOURCE}} |
| Support ticket trend | ticket volume and severity | stable | rising | spike or Sev-1 | {{SOURCE}} |

### C) Value and outcome signals (leading to lagging)
| Signal | Definition | Green | Amber | Red | Data source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Outcome progress | progress vs success criteria | on track | slipping | blocked | {{SOURCE}} |
| ROI proof points | measurable wins captured | ≥ 1 per quarter | 1 per half | none | {{SOURCE}} |

---

## 5) Health score rule (simple and runnable)
Avoid complex scoring in v1.

### Option A: Weighted bands (recommended)
- Product usage: 50%
- Engagement: 30%
- Value outcomes: 20%

Health band logic:
- **Green:** no Red signals and ≤ 2 Amber signals
- **Amber:** 1 Red signal OR ≥ 3 Amber signals
- **Red:** ≥ 2 Red signals OR 1 Red + ≥ 3 Amber signals

Document any override:
- “Red due to renewal risk even though usage is stable” (must include reason)

---

## 6) Intervention playbook (what to do when thresholds breach)

### If Product usage is Amber
Standard actions:
- Confirm friction: training gap vs product limitation vs workflow mismatch
- 30-minute enablement session with champion
- Reduce steps: identify 1–2 key workflows to drive weekly
- Set a 7-day adoption target and track daily

### If Product usage is Red
Standard actions:
- 48-hour recovery plan with owner + dates
- Re-align success criteria: “what outcome matters in 14 days”
- Escalate internally if feature gaps or integration breaks
- Schedule exec sponsor touchpoint if adoption is blocked by priority

### If Engagement is Red
Standard actions:
- Rebuild stakeholder map and sponsor access
- “Value recap” email with next 2 actions
- Set next meeting date before closing loop
- If sponsor absent 30+ days: escalate to leadership sponsor path

### If Outcome progress is Red
Standard actions:
- Re-scope success criteria into smaller milestones
- Remove blockers (support, product, integration)
- Define measurable checkpoint in 7 days
- Capture proof once milestone achieved

---

## 7) Weekly review tracker (copy this table per cohort)

### Weekly Customer Ops Review
**Week of:** {{DATE}}  
**Owner:** {{OWNER}}  
**Cohort:** {{SEGMENT or LIST}}

| Account | Health band | Red signals | Top risk | Intervention this week | Owner | Due date | Next checkpoint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| {{ACCOUNT_1}} | {{Green/Amber/Red}} | {{Signals}} | {{Risk}} | {{Action}} | {{Name}} | {{Date}} | {{Date}} |
| {{ACCOUNT_2}} | {{Green/Amber/Red}} | {{Signals}} | {{Risk}} | {{Action}} | {{Name}} | {{Date}} | {{Date}} |

**Notes / decisions:**  
- {{Decision_1}}  
- {{Decision_2}}

## 8) Risk register link (single source of truth)
This health template should always connect to a Risk Register.
If you do not have one yet, create: `Renewal-Risk-Register.md` in this folder.

---

## 9) Tool notes (optional)
- Data source: {{Mixpanel / GA / Internal DB / CRM}}
- Update automation: {{n8n workflow name}}
- Logging destination: {{Sheet / Airtable / CRM object}}

---

## 10) Sanitization rules (public repo)
Replace all identifiers with placeholders:
`{{CUSTOMER_NAME}}`, `{{ACCOUNT_ID}}`, `{{CSM_NAME}}`, `{{SOURCE}}`
No PII, no private links, no tokens.
