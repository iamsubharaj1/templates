**Operator-grade templates for Customer Ops and execution governance**

This repository is a reusable kit of templates that turns execution from ad-hoc to repeatable.
If a team is running on memory, meetings, or heroics, these templates create structure: **ownership, signals, routines, and next actions**.

---

## 1) What this repo is for
Use this library when you need to:
- run consistent QBRs that lead to decisions, not slides
- prevent renewal surprises by making readiness measurable
- detect risk early using leading indicators, not gut feel
- keep KPI reviews outcome-driven with clear follow-ups
- standardize quality across multiple locations without micromanagement
- communicate escalations with calm, structured updates

---

## 2) Template operating standard (how everything is written)
Every template in this repo follows the same execution spine:

**Outcome → Scope → Owner/RACI → Signals & thresholds → Routine → Actions → Artifacts → Closure**

This makes templates plug-and-play across teams and easy to train.

## 4) Recommended folder structure (created as templates are added)
- `/customer-ops/`
- `/governance/`
- `/standardization/`
- `/comms/`

---

## 5) Start here (recommended build order)
If you create only five templates first, create these:

1. **Action Register**  
   One tracker for all follow-ups: owner, due date, status, blockers.

2. **KPI Review Routine + Scorecard**  
   A repeatable review format that forces decisions and assigns next actions.

3. **Renewal Readiness Tracker**  
   T-90 to renewal checklist with risks, triggers, and save motions.

4. **Health Signals Template**  
   Leading indicators with thresholds and interventions, so risk is caught early.

5. **Escalation Update Template**  
   A calm, structured comms format for stakeholders during incidents.

These five templates create a complete operating loop: **signals → review → actions → communication → stability**.

---

## 6) How to adopt (no theory, just execution)
1. Start with **one** template that solves today’s pain:
   - renewal surprises → Renewal Readiness Tracker
   - messy reviews → KPI Review Routine + Action Register
   - reactive firefighting → Health Signals + Escalation Update format
2. Run it weekly for **3 cycles**.
3. Lock definitions of done and thresholds.
4. Only then automate the repetitive parts.

---

## 7) Quality bar (what is acceptable here)
Templates must be:
- usable in under 15 minutes to set up
- explicit on ownership and next actions
- consistent in structure so people do not reinvent formatting
- designed to reduce meetings, not add meetings

---

## 8) Privacy note
All templates are generalized and sanitized. No customer names, internal identifiers, or confidential data is included.
